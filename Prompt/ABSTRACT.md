## 1. Introduction

In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence, the quality of user-provided prompts is paramount to achieving accurate and relevant outputs from large language models (LLMs) and other generative systems. The process of "prompt engineering" is often a manual and iterative task, requiring users to have a deep understanding of the underlying model. This project addresses the common challenge users face in formulating effective prompts.

## 2. Objective

The primary objective of this project is to design and develop a command-line interface (CLI) application in Java that automatically refines user-supplied prompts. The tool will analyze a given prompt and apply a series of transformations to enhance its clarity, specificity, and overall effectiveness, thereby improving the quality of the generated results.

## 3. Methodology

The project will be implemented as a standalone Java application. It will accept a raw text prompt as a command-line argument. The core of the application will consist of a prompt processing engine that implements a set of predefined refinement rules. These rules may include, but are not limited to, adding context, clarifying intent, and formatting the prompt for optimal model performance. The refined prompt will then be output to the console for the user.

## 4. Expected Outcomes

The final deliverable will be a functional CLI tool that successfully transforms basic user prompts into more sophisticated and effective ones. This project will not only serve as a practical application of Java programming principles but also as an exploration into the fundamentals of prompt engineering. The tool will provide a foundation that can be extended with more advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques in the future.
