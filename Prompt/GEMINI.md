# Project Overview: Prompt Refiner CLI Tool

This directory contains the abstract and combined abstract for a project titled "Prompt Refiner: A Command-Line Tool for Enhancing User Prompts." The project aims to develop a Java-based command-line interface (CLI) application that refines user-supplied prompts for large language models (LLMs) and other generative systems.

## Directory Contents:

*   `ABSTRACT.md`: Contains the individual abstract outlining the project's introduction, objective, methodology, and expected outcomes.
*   `COMBINED_ABSTRACT.md`: Contains a combined version of the project abstract (content not yet reviewed in detail, but assumed to be a compilation or slightly modified version of `ABSTRACT.md` for different submission needs).

## Project Purpose:

The "Prompt Refiner" project seeks to address the challenge of prompt engineering by automatically enhancing the clarity, specificity, and overall effectiveness of user prompts. This is intended to improve the quality of generated results from AI models.

## Key Technologies (Planned):

*   **Language:** Java
*   **Application Type:** Command-Line Interface (CLI)

## Usage:

Currently, this directory serves as a repository for the project's abstract documentation. Future development will involve implementing the Java CLI tool.

**Keywords:** Prompt Engineering, Command-Line Interface (CLI), Java, Large Language Models (LLM), Natural Language Processing (NLP).
